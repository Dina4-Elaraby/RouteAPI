                 ----------------------APIS----------------------
API:Stand for Application Programming Interface 
. it's contains many endpoints.
EndsPoint:it's a url that represent to a specific funtion to exexute the logic in it.
WebAppAPI:it's a container to different types of API

***Types of APIs:
<1>RESTful API:
     .Stand for Representatial State Transfer
     .It's an architecture style
     .work on http request (get,post,delete,...)
     .must determine http method to interact with function or resources which you wanna get
     .every resource you wanna get can get by url 
     .Return date in json or XML file
     .Simple,common,understandable
     .Can make cashing=> not every time i need data send request to DB, i can make cashing data local in case if i order it again.
     
<2>SOAP API:
    .Stand for Simple Object Access Protocol
    .it's a protocol (في حد ذاتها) not follow http protocol as it's protocol
    .Return Date as XML File and send request as XML 
    .hard in implmentation from RESTful API as XML
    .More Security than RESTful API
    .Less Performance as XML than RESTful API as JSON is faster.

<3>GraphQL:
   .More flexiable than RESTful API,SOAP API for client
   .Single endpoint you interact with it 
   .Front can determine formate returned
   .it query language,client can fetch data, determine formate data by query send
   .can work on Life time app as chatting app,dashboard
   .More Complexity than RESTful API
   .Dynamic app,real time data.
